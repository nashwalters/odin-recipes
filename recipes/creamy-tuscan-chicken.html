    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Be sure to have some crusty bread on hand, because this sauce is KILLER. When it comes to chicken breast recipes, its hard to beat this one. The sauce is simple, but so flavorful. It's full of garlic, tomatoes, and most importantly, cream. It's bright and easy and just as good in the summer as it is in the winter.</p>
